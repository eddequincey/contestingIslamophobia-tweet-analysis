# contestingIslamophobia-tweet-analysis
This repository contains some of the code developed as part of the AHRC funded project “#ContestingIslamophobia: Representation and Appropriation in Mediated Activism" which examined the dynamics of anti- and pro-Muslim online activism. Using Twitter # campaigns as its starting point we focus on the appropriation of global ‘trigger’ events, such as terror attacks, by right wing US activists to create anti-Muslim narratives, and how these narratives are in turn opposed by anti-racist groups.

This repository does not contain the code developed to collect and filter tweets, only the code used to analyse tweets and create a number of files (csv, xlsx) and visualisations.
